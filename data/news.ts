      "A jangly pedi-cab, an essential means of transport in Old Delhi, could also take you to this New York theater district newcomer inspired in part by the Indian location. The chefs, Gaurav Anand and Vipul Gupta, look to that chaotic city as well as to the more contemporary grandeur of New Delhi for their menu. From Old Delhi comes 18th century tradition with lentil dumplings and lamb shoulder kebabs. New Delhi suggests okra fritters and tandoori branzino. Spice-driven drinks pepper the cocktail list and it all happens in a colorful dining room touched with luxury.",

      "In Times Square, Dilli Dilli recreates the iconic dishes of the new and old cities of Delhi. From the chef behind Moti Mahal Delux and Baazi on the UWS, this Indian restaurant with cane-backed chairs and moody lighting offers snack-y small plates with things like chaat and kebabs, and larger ones too: butter chicken inspired by a classic late-night spot, for example, and daal from a famous hotel restaurant.",

    description:
      "The menu is quite literally split into plates inspired by Old Delhi and New Delhi, and as such, you should make it a point to try from both side. Dishes arrive sizzling on cast irons, nested in masala dabba tins, and adorned on gold plates. A tapas-style portion pays homage to the street snacks scattered throughout Delhi, and just about everything comes paired with a delicious chutney — we recommend dipping everything into everything. It's rare to find a restaurant where every appetizer, entrée, and dessert feels standout, but Dilli Dilli shows remarkable consistency.",
